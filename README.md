This code was created as part of a small chemistry project at INSA Rouen Normandie.

This code was created using the following repository as a base: 

314arhaam - McCabe-Thiele: https://github.com/314arhaam/McCabe-Thiele

Comments in the code are in English and some in French.

The data can be found, for example, on the NIST website (https://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/).

For the reboiler and condenser, you'll need to run the code again after adding data for these parts.
